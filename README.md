# Stata-RandomPlan

Stata code:
This code creates a randomization plan.

Twenty tasks are completed under three dimensions.  The combination of the three dimensions results in eight different conditions.
Two raters will evaluate the tasks.

Ten percent of the tasks are repeated, so that the duplicates will give a chance to check intrarater reliability.

A second version of the code, sets the repeats so that the same tasks are repeated for each rater.
This duplication will give a chance to check intrarater and interrater reliability.


Information in the code is redacted to obscure the specific project.

The evaluation happens over ten days.
Each day has two sessions.
Within each session, the order of tasks is randomized (and set through this plan).
